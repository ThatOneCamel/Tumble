Ideas:
	$uptime
		- Returns bot total uptime in a dm to the user that asks

	$subs
		- Returns who a user is subscribed to

	$blah
		- lorem ipsum

Fixes:
	Bot currently does not store all encountered posts, it only saves the instance of posts it gets
	For example: If the page has 10 posts when it is downloaded, those 10 will be stored in the txt file and be acknowledged as old posts
		If a new post, #11, comes along it pushes out the oldest of the previous 10, and that post is lost from the text file
			IE: Old posts get overwritten in the text file and due to new postings; new posts should be appended instead of overwriting all post history
